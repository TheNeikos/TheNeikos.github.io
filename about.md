Hello there. I haven't got a lot to talk about yet in my life, but there are a
few things I am willing to share anyway.

I'm a developer. Currently my favorite languages to get stuff done are *C* and
*Ruby*. I'm currently studying at the University of Furtwangen in Germany, I am
trying to get my Bachelors in General Informatics.

For development I mainly use the Vim editor and the Linux commandline. My
preferred Linux distribution is Arch, which I am currently using.
A huge fan of git it was only natural to host this website on Github, so that's
what I did. (They really have an awesome array of service!)

If I am not studying or working on a project I play Dota 2 or League of Legends.
