title: The Duck which is actually a Mouse
---

Today, during our project work, we had decided to finally get ourselves a
plushie. However, we didn't find any that seemed to suit our tastes. So we
settled with [this mouse](http://i.imgur.com/GeuprRS.jpg). It's fairly iconic
in Germany for being an educational program. So we thought it fitting to use
as our [duck](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rubber_duck_debugging).

Will post a picture once it's here!
