I'm pretty sure you all know about [Reddit](https://reddit.com) a pretty cool website with thousands of sub communities
that post stuff related to a given interest. They have a voting system that is meant to filter the bad posts from the
good (at least relative to the subreddit) and is usually succesful at that. Vote Manipulation exists but usually 
only in the larger subreddits where it is much more competitive to get a post known.

Now, here are the reasons why I think Reddit to be a subpar breeding-ground for relationships. Which might or might
not be something that is wanted from a community. I know that I do not like hollow discussion, so I find it usually
rather dull to talk to a stranger, I will probably never see them again, I have nothing to gain from this, why bother, 
neither do they probably. But I digress.

### 1. There are usually no real identities to build a community around.

I think this one to be pretty obvious if you look at some of the communities that exist:

* League of Legends - A subreddit about the popular game with the same name
* Explain like I'm Five - A rather interesting Reddit that has some cool questions to show. 
  (It's not for literally five year olds.)
* Furry - A subreddit community about the Furry Fandom in general
* MildlyInteresting - A subreddit where you post interesting things, although only mildly ones.

While this is obviously a highly reduced set of reddits they each represent part of categories that I think
each subreddit fits in. You have the ones about an already existing thing, meant to *gather* and *discuss* content
that already exists. Both reasons are rather selfish, usually in the discussion you ask a question or try to point out something, and the content itself is either made by your or by someone else, and in the end you yourself don't matter 
a lot in it.

Then you have the one where you only interact with the subreddit itself. ELI5 does this, where redditors ask a question, hoping someone can boil it down for them in a friendly manner. 
It is much more informational than that it builds communities, that is fine, it was never meant to.

The furry subreddit is the only category here that I would really call a community, you can customize your own flair (kind of a public tag), the discussions range between a lot of different topics. This is good for a community and relationships between their users.

MildlyIntereting is a purely external subreddit, pretty much only pictures are posted there and that's what it's supposed to be. However, you cannot interact through pictures, so it's a dead end for people as well.

### 2. Threads disappear too quickly

This one is a real bummer, unless you ask an absolute question (one that can be answered at any time and stay true for a given amount of time) you will be out of luck on reddit if you think you can keep a discussion going for more than a few hours. And even then, the replies might be limited in size or quality, and due to the way voting works your post will soon disappear below more recent and/or more upvoted posts, leaving the discussion empty.

This is usually fixed in Forums by just letting them linger around, sure they get pushed back in but you can still go and answer to them later! Right now, the fix for this exposure problem is to repost. Literally, after a few hours you just post again, whether with a similar or slightly changed title, you will get lots of new batches coming in. This splits the community in lots of shards that have no similarity other than being there at a given time, unlike for example enjoying the same things.

### 3. Voting makes everything a game

Alright, you post something, as big or thoughtful as it is, there will be a number next to it. I don't upvote my posts, so I usually have a 0, sometimes a 1 or a 2, but usually 0. This puts you right at the bottom of the list of answers, but even with 0 your comment might still be worthwhile? Usually the highest comments get any kind of interaction, the others not so much.
