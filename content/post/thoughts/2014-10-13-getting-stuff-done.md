This is really something that I am spending a lot of my waking moments with.
"*What could I do right now?*" is a usual question I have. Recently I came to
the conclusion that _anything_ is better than nothing. This includes things
like just cleaning up something or reading up on an article you saved.

I will try to fill this time with blog posts now. I find that to be more
constructive than playing games or idling.
